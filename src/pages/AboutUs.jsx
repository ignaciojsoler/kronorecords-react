            Krono Records was born out of a belief that sound and image should
            elevate and contextualise one another to amplify emotion, engagement
            and recall. Our strength lies in translating a collective vision
            into a tangible piece of music or sound design. We always look to
            enter the creative process as early as possible to achieve synergy
            of picture and sound from the conception of a film or game to its
            playout. â€‹If you think that we can help you, please check our
            portfolio and feel free to make all the necessary questions.
